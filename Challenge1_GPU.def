	# Here are some base python libraries that are installed.
	# Feel free to add and remove any as needed.
	apt-get -y update
	apt-get -y install python
	apt-get -y install python-pip
	apt-get -y install python-opencv
	apt-get -y install nano

%runscript
	# Executes when the "singularity run" command is used

	##
	## The code for >>all<< your algorithms should be executed here
	##

	# Keep in mind that the input/ and output/ folders will be inside the /home/ directory
	
	cd /home/

	# Example code: 
	# Reads the images in /home/input/
	# 	processes them with three "novel" algorithms, and
	# 	saves the results of each of these algorithms in /home/output/[alg0, alg1, alg2]
	python copy_files.py 

%files
	##
	## Files to be transfered from your machine to the image
	## Any file necessary to execute your code (with the exception of the input images)
	## >>>SHOULD<<< be transferred to the image
	##

	# Usage:
	# yourfile /location/inside/image

	# Example code
	copy_files.py /home/

%test
	# Test script to verify that the image is built and running correctly
